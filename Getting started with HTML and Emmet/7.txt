7. Explain in brief about the nesting operators in emmet.
Nesting operators are used to position abbreviation elements inside generated tree: whether it should be placed inside or near the context element.

i.Child: >
You can use > operator to nest elements inside each other:

div>ul>li

ii.Sibling: +
Use + operator to place elements near each other, on the same level:

div+p+bq

iii.Climb-up: ^
With > operator youâ€™re descending down the generated tree and positions of all sibling elements will be resolved against the most deepest element:

div+div>p>span+em 

iv.Multiplication: *
With * operator you can define how many times element should be outputted:

ul>li*5
