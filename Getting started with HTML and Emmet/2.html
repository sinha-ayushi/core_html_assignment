    <h1>Comments</h1>
    <p>
        The Comment interface represents textual notations within markup; although it is generally not visually shown, such comments are available to be read in the source view.
        Comments are represented in HTML and XML as content between '<!--' and '-->'. In XML, like inside SVG or MathML markup, the character sequence '--' cannot be used within a comment.
