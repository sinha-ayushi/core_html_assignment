1.TAGS:
The name of an HTML element is the name that appears at the beginning of the element's start tag and at the end of the element's end tag (if the element has an end tag). For example, the p in the <p> start tag and </p> end tag is the name of the HTML paragraph element. Note that an element name in an end tag is preceded by a slash character: </p>, and that for void elements, the end tag is neither required nor allowed.

2.Elements:
Element is the most general base class from which all element objects (i.e. objects that represent elements) in a Document inherit. It only has methods and properties common to all kinds of elements. More specific classes inherit from Element.

3.Attributes:
In HTML, attributes provide additional information about an element. They are usually included in the opening tag of the element.
